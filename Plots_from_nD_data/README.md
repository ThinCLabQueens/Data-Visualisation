# Plots from n-D data

This script will generate 2d and 3d plots from every possible combination of an n-dimensional set of data.

To use, put a .csv file with the variables as rows and the observations as columns. Put variable names in the leftmost column and observation names in the topmost row (see example.csv).

Double click on RUN.bat.

You will find the figures in the "output plots" figure.
